OTF strives to support technology-centric solutions for anyone affected by censorship, surveillance, and internet blocking in order to protect fundamental human rights. These contracts are used to further our work observing and responding to internet censorship around the world and also to improve onion services, one of the few censorship circumvention technologies that allows users to route around censorship while simultaneously protecting their privacy and identity.
