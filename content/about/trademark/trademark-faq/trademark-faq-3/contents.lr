description:
Please don't use Tor in your product name or domain name.
Instead, find a name that will accurately identify your products or services.
Remember that our goal is to make sure that people aren't confused about whether your product or project is made or endorsed by The Tor Project.
Creating a new brand that incorporates the Tor brand is likely to lead to confusion, and commercial confusion is a sign of trademark infringement.
